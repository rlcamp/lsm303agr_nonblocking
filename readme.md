# LMS303AGR non-blocking state machine

This is a pair of modules which implement a set of nested non-blocking state machines for initializing and ingesting the output of an LSM303AGR magnetometer, from a SAMD51 or SAMD21 microcontroller, and an Arduino sketch illustrating their use. The core modules depend only upon the usual CMSIS and CMSIS-Atmel manufacturer header files for the SAMD chips.
